# Defects Summary – Notes & Navigation (2025-08-18)

## Executive Summary
- **Total defects:** 9  
- **Severity / Priority mix:**  
  - **Major / P2:** 4 (functional, content/UX, testability)  
  - **Minor / P3:** 5 (UI/UX/IA/a11y polish)  
- **Release gate:** **NO-GO** (see conclusion).  
- **Key risks:** data loss risk on delete, stale list after deletion, lack of stable test IDs blocking reliable automation, uncontrolled text overflow affecting readability and layout.

## Scope
Exploratory testing of Home and Notes (list, detail, create, delete, search UX). Desktop viewport only.

## Environment
- App: local dev (json-server + client)
- Browser: Chrome 126 (Windows 11)
- Viewport: 1366×850

| BUG-Notes-Delete-Hover-Animation-Misalignment | Delete action hover animation/icon misalignment | Minor | P3 | Notes | UI / UX |
| BUG-Notes-Cancel-Button-No-Hover-Feedback | Cancel button lacks hover/active visual feedback | Minor | P3 | Notes | UI / Usability |
| BUG-Notes-Create-Plus-Outside-Notes | Create (+) button is outside the Notes context/menu | Minor | P3 | Notes | UX / IA |
| BUG-Notes-Form-Fields-Low-Emphasis | Title and Content fields have low visual emphasis in create form | Minor | P3 | Notes | UI / A11y / Usability |
| BUG-Home-Redundant-TopRight-Home-Button | Redundant top-right Home button duplicates navigation | Minor | P3 | Home | UX / IA |

## Risk Assessment
- **Data integrity & user trust:** Immediate delete without confirmation and non-refreshing list create inconsistent outcomes and perceived failures, leading to repeated destructive actions.  
- **Readability & layout stability:** Unbounded content breaks card layout and readability; potential performance concerns with extreme input sizes.  
- **Automation & regression safety:** Absence of stable selectors (`data-cy`) severely limits E2E coverage and undermines regression confidence for future releases.  
- **UX consistency & a11y:** Multiple polish issues (hover states, emphasis, IA) reduce usability and can hinder discoverability.

## Recommendation
- **Status:** **NOT READY for Production**  
- **Required before re-evaluation:**
  1. Implement **delete confirmation** and **list refresh/optimistic update**.
  2. Add **character limits** (title/content) and **card truncation/clamping**.
  3. Adopt a **data-cy selector contract** for all interactive controls.
  4. Address UI/UX polish: hover feedback, field emphasis, IA placement of Create (+), redundant Home button.

- **Regression Plan:** After fixes, run full E2E regression (CRUD + search), visual checks on hover states, and a11y spot-checks. Ensure CI pipeline imports results into Xray and attaches evidence.

## Conclusion
> Given the errors found, the state of development contains enough errors of sufficient severity to be returned to the development team so that the problems can be solved and a regression test can be performed on the code again.
