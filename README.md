# QA Delivery Report — 10h Engagement
*Date:* 2025-08-19

---

## 1) Executive Overview
Within an estimated **~10 hours**, I established the **test project structure**, classified its layers, reviewed the application, and executed pertinent tests. I designed **Gherkin scenarios** and organized **step definitions** using **BDD** and **Page Objects**, making the suite **automation-ready** and maintainable.  
In addition, I created **Jira bug tickets** with a reusable **reporting template**, a **grouping model** to keep everything orderly, and a **concise summary report** for clear communication and control.

---

## 2) Scope & Assumptions
- **Scope:** Home and Notes areas (list, detail, search, create, edit, delete).
- **Out of scope:** Web interactions; advanced a11y audits; performance/load testing.
- **Assumptions:** Web runs locally with `json-server` + client; no authentication required.

---

## 3) Test Design & Architecture
### 3.1 Approach
- **BDD with Gherkin**: Readable scenarios mapped to business flows.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Stable abstraction for selectors and actions.
- **Selectors contract**: Proposed **`data-cy`** attributes for reliable automation.
- **Reports**: HTML via Mochawesome; **screenshots on failure** The names of the images have been automatically generated and are not real images. I have decided not to include screenshots so as not to clutter the code with images. Within the project, they would be stored in a designated folder or projected directly onto the reports in Jira/Xray.

### 3.2 Structure
- `cypress/e2e/**` — Gherkin features by domain (Home, Notes).
- `cypress/pageObjects/**` — `HomePage`, `NotesPage`, `NoteFormPage`.
- `cypress/selectors/**` — centralized selectors (`data-cy` contract).
- `cypress/support/**` — commands, global hooks, Xray helper.
- `scripts/xray/**` — **skeleton** for Xray upload & evidence attach.
- `docs/**` — strategy, Xray mapping, PO summary, **defects summary (NO-GO)**.
- `tickets/**` — Jira-ready bug cards + enhanced template.

---

## 4) What Was Implemented
### 4.1 Gherkin & Steps (automation-ready)
- Navigation (Home → Notes), list & detail rendering, search (match/no results).
- Create note (happy path) and **validation**: **no title ⇒ Save unavailable**.
- Edit note (rename title), **validation**: **empty title/content ⇒ Save unavailable**.
- **Edit body only** while keeping the title unchanged.
- Delete note (confirm & cancel paths).

### 4.2 Jira Bugs & Reporting
- **Enhanced Jira bug template** (`tickets/BUG-REPORT-TEMPLATE.md`).  
- **Defect catalog** (Markdown bug cards) with severity/priority and evidence.  
- **Grouped defects feature**: `tickets/bugs-notes.feature` (for quick triage).  
- **Defects Summary**: `docs/DEFECTS-SUMMARY.md` → **NO-GO** recommendation.

### 4.3 Xray / CI Skeleton
- **GitHub Actions** workflow to run Cypress and publish reports.
- **Xray upload scripts** (skeleton): `scripts/xray/upload-results.js` & `attach-evidence.js`.
- Xray README with **mapping & usage** (`scripts/xray/README.md`).

---

## 5) Deliverables Map
- **E2E Features**: `cypress/e2e/home/*.feature`, `cypress/e2e/notes/*.feature`  
- **Steps**: `cypress/e2e/notes/notes.steps.js` *(updated with new validations)*  
- **POM**: `cypress/pageObjects/HomePage.js`, `NotesPage.js`, `NoteFormPage.js`  
- **Selectors**: `cypress/selectors/home.js`, `cypress/selectors/notes.js`  
- **Reports**: `cypress/reports/html/**`, `cypress/reports/screenshots/**`  
- **Docs**: `docs/TEST-STRATEGY.md`, `docs/XRAY-MAPPING.md`, `docs/PO-summary.md`, `docs/DEFECTS-SUMMARY.md`  
- **Xray**: `scripts/xray/README.md`, `scripts/xray/upload-results.js`, `scripts/xray/attach-evidence.js`  
- **Tickets** (Jira-ready): `tickets/*.md` (9+1 issues), `tickets/bugs-notes.feature`

---

## 6) Time Breakdown (≈10h)
- **Environment & tooling setup (Cypress+Cucumber+POM+reporter):** ~3h  
- **Xray/CI skeleton & docs:** ~2h  
- **Feature files & steps (incl. latest validations/body-only edit):** ~3h  
- **Exploratory testing + bug cards + summary report:** ~2h

---

## 7) Key Findings (Short)
- **Major risks** (P2): delete flow **without confirmation**, **list not refreshed** after delete, **no character limits** (layout/readability issues), lack of **stable test IDs** for automation.  
- **UX/UI polish** (P3): hover feedback for Cancel, Delete icon animation/alignment, low emphasis on inputs, misplaced (+) Create, redundant Home button.

## 8) Closing Statement
This engagement delivered a **maintainable test foundation**, **clear BDD scenarios**, and a **structured defect backlog**. The project is positioned for fast iteration: once the fixes land, the suite can validate regressions and provide traceable, evidence-backed results via CI/Xray.
